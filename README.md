# TravelCircuit
Implements a trip advisor selector using C++ classes
 Uses classes inheritance and different static, private and public methods and variables to implement a trip advisor. The detailed requirements are given in the picture below. To run the program, just download the files and run them in a C++ compiler/ IDE. (I used Visual Studio Community)
